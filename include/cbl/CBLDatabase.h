/** \name  Scheduling notifications
    @{
    Applications may want control over when Couchbase Lite notifications (listener callbacks)
    happen. They may want them called on a specific thread, or at certain times during an event
    loop. This behavior may vary by database, if for instance each database is associated with a
    separate thread.

    The API calls here enable this. When notifications are "buffered" for a database, calls to
    listeners will be deferred until the application explicitly allows them. Instead, a single
    callback will be issued when the first notification becomes available; this gives the app a
    chance to schedule a time when the notifications should be sent and callbacks called.

    @note  This callback is called _only once_ until the next time \ref CBLDatabase_SendNotifications
            is called. If you don't respond by (sooner or later) calling that function,
            you will not be informed that any listeners are ready.
