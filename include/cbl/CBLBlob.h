/** \defgroup blobs Blobs
    @{
    A \ref CBLBlob is a binary data blob associated with a document.

    The content of the blob is not stored in the document, but externally in the database.
    It is loaded only on demand, and can be streamed. Blobs can be arbitrarily large, although
    Sync Gateway will only accept blobs under 20MB.

    The document contains only a blob reference: a dictionary with the special marker property
    `"@type":"blob"`, and another property `digest` whose value is a hex SHA-1 digest of the
    blob's data. This digest is used as the key to retrieve the blob data.
    The dictionary usually also has the property `length`, containing the blob's length in bytes,
    and it may have the property `content_type`, containing a MIME type.

    A \ref CBLBlob object acts as a proxy for such a dictionary in a \ref CBLDocument. Once
    you've loaded a document and located the \ref FLDict holding the blob reference, call
    \ref CBLBlob_Get on it to create a \ref CBLBlob object you can call.
    The object has accessors for the blob's metadata and for loading the data itself.

    To create a new blob from in-memory data, call \ref CBLBlob_CreateWithData, then call
    \ref FLMutableDict_SetBlob or \ref FLMutableArray_SetBlob to add the \ref CBLBlob to the
    document (or to a dictionary or array property of the document.)

    To create a new blob from a stream, call \ref CBLBlobWriter_New to create a
    \ref CBLBlobWriteStream, then make one or more calls to \ref CBLBlobWriter_Write to write
    data to the blob, then finally call \ref CBLBlob_CreateWithStream to create the blob.
    To store the blob into a document, do as in the previous paragraph.
