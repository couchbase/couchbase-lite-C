/** Formats and writes a message to the log, in the given domain at the given level.
    \warning This function takes a `printf`-style format string, with extra parameters to match the format placeholders,
             and has the same security vulnerabilities as other `printf`-style functions.

    If you are logging a fixed string, call \ref CBL_LogMessage instead, otherwise any `%`
    characters in the `format` string will be misinterpreted as placeholders and the dreaded
    Undefined Behavior will result, possibly including crashes or overwriting the stack.
    @param domain  The log domain to associate this message with.
    @param level  The severity of the message. If this is lower than the current minimum level for the domain
                 (as set by \ref CBLLog_SetConsoleLevel), nothing is logged.
    @param format  A `printf`-style format string. `%` characters in this string introduce parameters,
                 and corresponding arguments must follow.
    @warning  <b>Deprecated :</b> No alternative for this function and this function will be removed in the future release. */
