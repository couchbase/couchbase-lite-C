## *** NOTE: DO NOT MACHINE-UPDATE THIS FILE ***
##
## This started out as a machine-generated file (produced by `gen-bindings.sh`),
## but it has been hand-edited to fix issues that kept it from compiling.
##
## If you run the script again, it will generate a _new_ file `CouchbaseLite-new.nim`.
## You'll need to merge new/changed declarations from that file into this one, by hand.
##
## Status: Up-to-date as of 5 May 2020, commit 036cd9f7 "Export kCBLAuthDefaultCookieName...",
##         except I've left out the new "_s"-suffixed alternate functions, which Nim doesn't need.

## \defgroup refcounting   Reference Counting
##     Couchbase Lite "objects" are reference-counted; the functions below are the shared

##     type-cast.)
##
##     API functions that **create** a ref-counted object (typically named `..._New()` or `..._Create()`)
##     return the object with a ref-count of 1; you are responsible for releasing the reference
##     when you're done with it, or the object will be leaked.
##
##     Other functions that return an **existing** ref-counted object do not modify its ref-count.
##     You do _not_ need to release such a reference. But if you're keeping a reference to the object
##     for a while, you should retain the reference to ensure it stays alive, and then release it when
##     finished (to balance the retain.)
##

## \defgroup listeners   Listeners
##     Every API function that registers a listener callback returns an opaque token representing
##     the registered callback. To unregister any type of listener, call \ref CBLListener_Remove.
##
##     The steps to creating a listener are:
##     1. Define the type of contextual information the callback needs. This is usually one of
##         your objects, or a custom struct.
##     2. Implement the listener function:
##       - The parameters and return value must match the callback defined in the API.
##       - The first parameter is always a `void*` that points to your contextual
##           information, so cast that to the actual pointer type.
##       - **The function may be called on a background thread!** And since the CBL API is not itself
##           thread-safe, you'll need to take special precautions if you want to call the API
##           from your listener, such as protecting all of your calls (inside and outside the
##           listener) with a mutex. It's safer to use \ref CBLDatabase_BufferNotifications to
##           schedule listener callbacks to a time of your own choosing, such as your thread's
##           event loop; see that function's docs for details.
##     3. To register the listener, call the relevant `AddListener` function.
##       - The parameters will include the CBL object to observe, the address of your listener
##         function, and a pointer to the contextual information. (That pointer needs to remain
##         valid for as long as the listener is registered, so it can't be a pointer to a local
##         variable.)
##       - The return value is a \ref CBLListenerToken pointer; save that.
##     4. To unregister the listener, pass the \ref CBLListenerToken to \ref CBLListener_Remove.
##       - You **must** unregister the listener before the contextual information pointer is
##         invalidated, e.g. before freeing the object it points to.
##
## An opaque 'cookie' representing a registered listener callback.
##     It's returned from functions that register listeners, and used to remove a listener by
##     calling \ref CBLListener_Remove.
type
  CBLListenerToken* = ptr object

## Removes a listener callback, given the token that was returned when it was added.
proc remove*(a1: CBLListenerToken) {.importc: "CBLListener_Remove".}

##     chance to schedule a time when the notifications should be sent and callbacks called.

## \defgroup blobs Blobs
##     A \ref CBLBlob is a binary data blob associated with a document.
##
##     The content of the blob is not stored in the document, but externally in the database.
##     It is loaded only on demand, and can be streamed. Blobs can be arbitrarily large, although
##     Sync Gateway will only accept blobs under 20MB.
##
##     The document contains only a blob reference: a dictionary with the special marker property
##     blob's data. This digest is used as the key to retrieve the blob data.
##     The dictionary usually also has the property `length`, containing the blob's length in bytes,
##     and it may have the property `content_type`, containing a MIME type.
##
##     A \ref CBLBlob object acts as a proxy for such a dictionary in a \ref CBLDocument. Once
##     you've loaded a document and located the \ref FLDict holding the blob reference, call
##     \ref CBLBlob_Get on it to create a \ref CBLBlob object you can call.
##     The object has accessors for the blob's metadata and for loading the data itself.
##
##     To create a new blob from in-memory data, call \ref CBLBlob_CreateWithData, then call
##     \ref FLMutableDict_SetBlob or \ref FLMutableArray_SetBlob to add the \ref CBLBlob to the
##     document (or to a dictionary or array property of the document.)
##
##     To create a new blob from a stream, call \ref CBLBlobWriter_New to create a
##     \ref CBLBlobWriteStream, then make one or more calls to \ref CBLBlobWriter_Write to write
##     data to the blob, then finally call \ref CBLBlob_CreateWithStream to create the blob.
##     To store the blob into a document, do as in the previous paragraph.

##     that resembles a parse tree of N1QL. The JSON syntax is harder for humans, but much more

    err: var CBLError): CBLQuery {.importc: "CBLQuery_New".}

## Assigns values to the query's parameters.
##     These values will be substited for those parameters whenever the query is executed,
##     until they are next assigned.
##
##     Parameters are specified in the query source as
##     e.g. `$PARAM` (N1QL) or `["$PARAM"]` (JSON). In this example, the `parameters` dictionary
##     to this call should have a key `PARAM` that maps to the value of the parameter.
##             keys are the parameter names. (It's easiest to construct this by using the mutable
##             API, i.e. calling \ref FLMutableDict_New and adding keys/values.)

## Returns information about the query, including the translated SQLite form, and the search

##     The column name is based on its expression in the `SELECT...` or `WHAT:` section of the
##     query. A column that returns a property or property path will be named after that property.
##     A column that returns an expression will have an automatically-generated name like `$1`.
##     To give a column a custom name, use the `AS` syntax in the query.
##     Every column is guaranteed to have a unique name.

## \name  Result sets
##     A `CBLResultSet` is an iterator over the results returned by a query. It exposes one
##     result at a time -- as a collection of values indexed either by position or by name --
##     and can be stepped from one result to the next.
##
##     It's important to note that the initial position of the iterator is _before_ the first
##     result, so \ref CBLResultSet_Next must be called _first_. Example:
##
##     ```
##     CBLResultSet *rs = CBLQuery_Execute(query, &error);
##     assert(rs);
##     while (CBLResultSet_Next(rs) {
##         FLValue aValue = CBLResultSet_ValueAtIndex(rs, 0);
##         ...
##     }
##     CBLResultSet_Release(rs);
##     ```
##
## Moves the result-set iterator to the next result.
##     Returns false if there are no more results.
proc next*(a1: CBLResultSet): bool {.importc: "CBLResultSet_Next".}

## Returns the value of a column of the current result, given its (zero-based) numeric index.
##     This may return a NULL pointer, indicating `MISSING`, if the value doesn't exist, e.g. if
##     the column is a property that doesn't exist in the document.
proc valueAtIndex*(a1: CBLResultSet; index: cuint): FLValue {.
    importc: "CBLResultSet_ValueAtIndex".}

## Returns the value of a column of the current result, given its name.
##     This may return a NULL pointer, indicating `MISSING`, if the value doesn't exist, e.g. if
##     the column is a property that doesn't exist in the document. (Or, of course, if the key
##     is not a column name in this query.)
proc valueForKey*(a1: CBLResultSet; key: cstring): FLValue {.
    importc: "CBLResultSet_ValueForKey".}

## Returns the current result as an array of column values.
##    @warning The array reference is only valid until the result-set is advanced or released.
##            If you want to keep it for longer, call \ref FLArray_Retain (and release it when done.)
proc rowArray*(rs: CBLResultSet): FLArray {.importc: "CBLResultSet_RowArray".}

## Returns the current result as a dictionary mapping column names to values.
##    @warning The dict reference is only valid until the result-set is advanced or released.
##            If you want to keep it for longer, call \ref FLDict_Retain (and release it when done.)
proc rowDict*(rs: CBLResultSet): FLDict {.importc: "CBLResultSet_RowDict".}

## Returns the CBLQuery that created this CBLResultSet.
proc getQuery*(rs: CBLResultSet): CBLQuery {.importc: "CBLResultSet_GetQuery".}

## \name  Change listener
##     Adding a change listener to a query turns it into a "live query". When changes are made to
##     documents, the query will periodically re-run and compare its results with the prior
##     results; if the new results are different, the listener callback will be called.
##
##             rows that changed.

## \name  CBLDatabase Indexes
##     Indexes are used to speed up queries by allowing fast -- O(log n) -- lookup of documents
##     that have specific values or ranges of values. The values may be properties, or expressions
##     based on properties.
##
##     An index will speed up queries that use the expression it indexes, but it takes up space in
##     the database file, and it slows down document saves slightly because it needs to be kept up
##     to date when documents change.
##
##     Tuning a database with indexes can be a tricky task. Fortunately, a lot has been written about
##     it in the relational-database (SQL) realm, and much of that advice holds for Couchbase Lite.
##     You may find SQLite's documentation particularly helpful since Couchbase Lite's querying is
##     based on SQLite.
##
##     Two types of indexes are currently supported:
##  FLValue indexes speed up queries by making it possible to look up property (or expression)
##           values without scanning every document. They're just like regular indexes in SQL or N1QL.
##           Multiple expressions are supported; the first is the primary key, second is secondary.
##           Expressions must evaluate to scalar types (boolean, number, string).
##  Full-Text Search (FTS) indexes enable fast search of natural-language words or phrases
##           by using the `MATCH` operator in a query. A FTS index is **required** for full-text
##           search: a query with a `MATCH` operator will fail to compile unless there is already a
##           FTS index for the property/expression being matched. Only a single expression is
##           currently allowed, and it must evaluate to a string.
## Types of database indexes.

    kValueIndex, ## An index that stores property or expression values
