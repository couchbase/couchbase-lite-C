/**
 * Initialize the log level of each log domains to DEBUG so that
 * the log level of all domains could be controlled by using c4log_setCallbackLevel()
 * and c4log_writeToBinaryFile() and setup the log callback with the WARNING as its default
 * log level.
 *
 * This method is safe to call multiple times but the initializing logic will be executed only
 * once when the method is called the first time.
 *
 * @NOTE As we cannot use static initializer to initialize the log level and the log callback,
 * we will need to call CBLLog_Init() from the top level methods that logs (level < Warnings)
 * are expected including CBLDatabase's open(), copyDatabase(), deleteDatabase(),
 * Andriod's CBL_Init(), and any methods used for configuring logs in CBLLog.cc.
 *
 * In the future, if calling CBLLog_Init() becomes painfully hard to track, we could consider
 * changing the default log level of each domain in LiteCore from INFO to WARNING so that calling
 * CBLLog_Init() is not needed beside from the methods used for configuring logs.
