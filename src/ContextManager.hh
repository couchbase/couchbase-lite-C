     Thread-safe context manager for retaining and mapping the object with its pointer value which can be used
     as a (captured) context for LiteCore's callback which could be either in C++ or C. This would allow the
     callback to verify that the context pointer value is still valid or not before using it. The implementation simply
     stores the object in a map by using its memory address as the key and returns the memory address as
     the pointer value.
      
     @note
     There is a chance that a new registered objects may have the same memory address as the ones previously
     unregistered. This implementation can be improved to reduce a chance of reusing the same memory address
     by generating integer keys with reuseable integer number + cycle count as inspired by the implementation of
     C# GCHandle. For now, the context object MUST BE validated for its originality before use. */
